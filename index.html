        <p>Dear Brother's,</p>
      </div>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m Akash Raj I did my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Panimalar Polytechnic College & B.E Mechanical Engineering in Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College. I’m first graduate. Right now working in Addison & co ltd (contract role) as a Quality Inspector (CMM Inspection).<br><br>
        
I’m being here for the past two years but I can’t find any improvement in my career. So I thought of changing my stream but I don’t know which stream should I choose in the pandemic corona situation. Even I had fear of changing the stream and kept it on hold. <br><br>
        
On that time I saw your interview in youtube. After that I saw George brother bridge class video also and started studying and practicing on HMTL, CSS & MYSQL. I would like to explore and learn new things. If I get a chance then I will prove myself. <br><br>
        
I’m looking forward to be a part of mac app family.<br><br>
